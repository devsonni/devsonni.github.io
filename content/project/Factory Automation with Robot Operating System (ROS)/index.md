summary: This project was a course work of [this](https://www.edx.org/course/hello-real-world-with-ros-robot-operating-system) course. Project consists of setting up **Pub-Sub** mechanism for communicating between two ROS nodes, modifying **URDF** model of factory, ROS **Navigation stack** for navigating turtle bot in factory environment, manipulation of robotic arm by ROS **MoveIt** package and behaviour setup with **FlexBE App** state machine.

# 💥Factory automation by using ROS(Robot Operating System)🤖        

##  👇 This project is mainly divided into 3-4 chunks.       
 🤝 Pub-Sub mechanism of ROS.     
 🧭 Navigation package of ROS.     
 🎛️ Manipulation by Moveit ROS package.     
 🙌 Final factory Automation using all these chunks.         
##          

### 🤝 Pub-Sub Mechanism
