Proof of concept round (won 2,00,000 INR for building proper working proof of concept \u0026amp; for building final prototype). Finale (won 5,00,000 INR ~ 6,600 USD as a winning prize). In short, we avail total of 7,50,000 INR in this project.  Technical Details  Human gait trajectories was analysed \u0026amp; plotted with the use of kinovea software. Torque requirements of each lower-limb joints was calculated with the use of musculoskeletal model in opensim software. According to torque requirements DC planetary geared motors was selected and spur gears was designed. Whole body with the gears was designed in solidworks. Six proportional derivative and integral (PID) controllers was coded on arduino micro-controller in a way that follows the angle inputs and feedback was given by encoders. All system parameters such as PID constants, speed of exoskeleton, \u0026amp; etc. was tuned by trial and error method.

Production  Weigh the required amount of material for your mold + 20%. Fill the mold with material. Put the upper part of the mold on the plastic. Put the mold in the oven. Leave it for 15 minutes. Turn the mold 180¬∞ in the oven. Leave it for another 15 minutes. Compress the mold. Take the mold out of the oven. Put clamps on the mold to keep the pressure. Place another mold in the oven.  Cooldown  Clean the inside of the oven from molten plastic. Tips \u0026amp; tricks while using It is advisable to heat up the plastic until melted and then apply pressure.
