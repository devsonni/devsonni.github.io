The controller is capable of avoiding the environmental obstacles that block the path of the AAV. It also ensures that the car always lies in the field of view (FOV) of the camera while satisfying the control and state constraints. The controller is able to learn from the previous iterations and improve the tracking performance with the help of reinforcement learning (RL).

Proof of concept round (won 2,00,000 INR for building a proper working proof of concept \u0026amp; for building the final prototype). Finale (won 5,00,000 INR ~ 6,600 USD as a winning prize). In short, we avail a total of 7,50,000 INR in this project.  Technical Details  Human gait trajectories were analyzed \u0026amp; plotted with the use of kinovea software. Torque requirements of each lower-limb joint were calculated with the use of the musculoskeletal model in OpenSim software. According to torque requirements DC planetary geared motors were selected and spur gears were designed. Whole-body with the gears was designed in SolidWorks. Six proportional derivative and integral (PID) controllers were coded on Arduino micro-controller in a way that follows the angle inputs and feedback was given by encoders. All system parameters such as PID constants, speed of exoskeleton \u0026amp;, etc. was tuned by trial and error method.
