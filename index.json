Proof of concept round (won 2,00,000 INR for building a proper working proof of concept \u0026amp; for building the final prototype). Finale (won 5,00,000 INR ~ 6,600 USD as a winning prize). In short, we avail a total of 7,50,000 INR in this project.  Technical Details  Human gait trajectories were analyzed \u0026amp; plotted with the use of kinovea software. Torque requirements of each lower-limb joint were calculated with the use of the musculoskeletal model in OpenSim software. According to torque requirements DC planetary geared motors were selected and spur gears were designed. Whole-body with the gears was designed in SolidWorks. Six proportional derivative and integral (PID) controllers were coded on Arduino micro-controller in a way that follows the angle inputs and feedback was given by encoders. All system parameters such as PID constants, speed of exoskeleton \u0026amp;, etc. was tuned by trial and error method.  Currently, Robot is showcasing at India‚Äôs first \u0026amp; only Robotics gallery in Ahmadabad, Gujarat. Watch the linked video to see the robot working.

It will send power to the heaters until PV (point variable) matches the SV (set value). It does this using readings from the thermocouple and the SSR. SSR: the Solid State Relay is an electronic ‚Äòswitch‚Äô that opens and closes depending on the signal it receives (from the PID). Thermocouple: basically a thermometer.

Production  Weigh the required amount of material for your mold + 20%. Fill the mold with material. Put the upper part of the mold on the plastic. Put the mold in the oven. Leave it for 15 minutes. Turn the mold 180¬∞ in the oven. Leave it for another 15 minutes. Compress the mold. Take the mold out of the oven. Put clamps on the mold to keep the pressure. Place another mold in the oven.  Cooldown  Clean the inside of the oven from molten plastic. Tips \u0026amp; tricks while using It is advisable to heat up the plastic until melted and then apply pressure. Don‚Äôt be hasty, make sure the plastic is fully melted in the mold.
